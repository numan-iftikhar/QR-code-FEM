## My process

* I started with the HTML
* Styled with CSS
* Struggled a bit to center div.container üòÅ
* But I was missing height: 100vh;
* Lastly, updated the README.md

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make a QR card and center div.container

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    card content...
  </div>
</body>
```
```css
body{
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

From now on, I'll be focussing on CSS Grid
